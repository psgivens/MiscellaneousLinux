# DNX, EFC, and Sqlite

This project is created completely with free software from the community and from Microsoft. I am developing on Ubuntu 16.04 using Visual Studio Code. This is my first sample with this new environment. 

The purpose of this project is to create the simplest example of working with dotnet core, entity framework core, and sqlite on linux. It is a stepping stone to creating a sample with PostgreSql. 

The purpose of this document is to provide notes on how to set up my project to work with this stack.

I started with this document, but found that it was out of date, but that is wehre the name of this project comes from.

I then found this document which worked great. Just follow that. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/netcore/new-db-sqlite

Now, the real task was to do the same with PostgreSql. See SecondLookEFCore for that example. 

I recommend installing Sqlite Browser. Instructions can be found here:
