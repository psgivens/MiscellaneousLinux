h2. *PS-1*: PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PS family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.


h3. The organization:

* *PS-1a.*: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
** *PS-1a.1.*: A personnel security policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
** *PS-1a.2.*: Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personnel security policy and associated personnel security controls; and
* *PS-1b.*: Reviews and updates the current:
** *PS-1b.1.*: Personnel security policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
** *PS-1b.2.*: Personnel security procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

h2. *PS-2*: POSITION RISK DESIGNATION

Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management policy and guidance. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements (e.g., training, security clearances).


h3. The organization:

* *PS-2a.*: Assigns a risk designation to all organizational positions;
* *PS-2b.*: Establishes screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and
* *PS-2c.*: Reviews and updates position risk designations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


----


h2. *PS-3*: PERSONNEL SCREENING

Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, and specific criteria established for the risk designations of assigned positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions and frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems.


h3. The organization:

* *PS-3a.*: Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system; and
* *PS-3b.*: Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the frequency of such rescreening].


----


h2. *PS-4*: PERSONNEL TERMINATION

Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.


h3. The organization, upon termination of individual employment:

* *PS-4a.*: Disables information system access within [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
* *PS-4b.*: Terminates/revokes any authenticators/credentials associated with the individual;
* *PS-4c.*: Conducts exit interviews that include a discussion of [Assignment: organization-defined information security topics];
* *PS-4d.*: Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property;
* *PS-4e.*: Retains access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by terminated individual; and
* *PS-4f.*: Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period].

h2. *PS-5*: PERSONNEL TRANSFER

This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are permanent or of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted. Organizations define actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include, for example: (i) returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building passes; (ii) closing information system accounts and establishing new accounts; (iii) changing information system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); and (iv) providing for access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in previous information system accounts.


h3. The organization:

* *PS-5a.*: Reviews and confirms ongoing operational need for current logical and physical access authorizations to information systems/facilities when individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization;
* *PS-5b.*: Initiates [Assignment: organization-defined transfer or reassignment actions] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period following the formal transfer action];
* *PS-5c.*: Modifies access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in operational need due to reassignment or transfer; and
* *PS-5d.*: Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


----


h2. *PS-6*: ACCESS AGREEMENTS

Access agreements include, for example, nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed access agreements include an acknowledgement that individuals have read, understand, and agree to abide by the constraints associated with organizational information systems to which access is authorized. Organizations can use electronic signatures to acknowledge access agreements unless specifically prohibited by organizational policy.

----


h2. *PS-7*: THIRD-PARTY PERSONNEL SECURITY

Third-party providers include, for example, service bureaus, contractors, and other organizations providing information system development, information technology services, outsourced applications, and network and security management. Organizations explicitly include personnel security requirements in acquisition-related documents. Third-party providers may have personnel working at organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or information system privileges issued by organizations. Notifications of third-party personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and credentials. Organizations define the transfers and terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics that include, for example, functions, roles, and nature of credentials/privileges associated with individuals transferred or terminated.


h3. The organization:

* *PS-7a.*: Establishes personnel security requirements including security roles and responsibilities for third-party providers;
* *PS-7b.*: Requires third-party providers to comply with personnel security policies and procedures established by the organization;
