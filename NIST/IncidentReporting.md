h2. *IR-1*: INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.


h3. The organization:

* *IR-1a.*: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
** *IR-1a.1.*: An incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
** *IR-1a.2.*: Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and associated incident response controls; and
* *IR-1b.*: Reviews and updates the current:
** *IR-1b.1.*: Incident response policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
** *IR-1b.2.*: Incident response procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

h2. *IR-2*: INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING

Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the information system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal sources.


h3. The organization provides incident response training to information system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

* *IR-2a.*: Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming an incident response role or responsibility;
* *IR-2b.*: When required by information system changes; and
* *IR-2c.*: [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.


----


h2. *IR-3*: INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response.


h3. The organization tests the incident response capability for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests] to determine the incident response effectiveness and documents the results.



----


h2. *IR-4*: INCIDENT HANDLING

Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function).


h3. The organization:

* *IR-4a.*: Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;
* *IR-4b.*: Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and
* *IR-4c.*: Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.


----


h2. *IR-5*: INCIDENT MONITORING

Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example, maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports.


h3. The organization tracks and documents information system security incidents.



----


h2. *IR-6*: INCIDENT REPORTING

The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and their subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling.


h3. The organization:

* *IR-6a.*: Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
* *IR-6b.*: Reports security incident information to [Assignment: organization-defined authorities].


----


h2. *IR-7*: INCIDENT RESPONSE ASSISTANCE

Incident response support resources provided by organizations include, for example, help desks, assistance groups, and access to forensics services, when required.


h3. The organization provides an incident response support resource, integral to the organizational incident response capability that offers advice and assistance to users of the information system for the handling and reporting of security incidents.



----


h2. *IR-8*: INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN

It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response. Organizational missions, business functions, strategies, goals, and objectives for incident response help to determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a comprehensive incident response capability, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including, for example, external service providers and organizations involved in the supply chain for organizational information systems.


h3. The organization:

* *IR-8a.*: Develops an incident response plan that:
** *IR-8a.1.*: Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability;
** *IR-8a.2.*: Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability;
** *IR-8a.3.*: Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization;
** *IR-8a.4.*: Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions;
** *IR-8a.5.*: Defines reportable incidents;
** *IR-8a.6.*: Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;
** *IR-8a.7.*: Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability; and
** *IR-8a.8.*: Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
* *IR-8b.*: Distributes copies of the incident response plan to [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];
* *IR-8c.*: Reviews the incident response plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];
* *IR-8d.*: Updates the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
* *IR-8e.*: Communicates incident response plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; and
* *IR-8f.*: Protects the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.


----


h2. *IR-9*: INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE

Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of lower sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational response is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.


h3. The organization responds to information spills by:

* *IR-9a.*: Identifying the specific information involved in the information system contamination;
* *IR-9b.*: Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the information spill using a method of communication not associated with the spill;
* *IR-9c.*: Isolating the contaminated information system or system component;
* *IR-9d.*: Eradicating the information from the contaminated information system or component;
* *IR-9e.*: Identifying other information systems or system components that may have been subsequently contaminated; and
* *IR-9f.*: Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions].

h2. *IR-10*: INTEGRATED INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSIS TEAM

Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat in order to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This enables the team to identify adversary TTPs that are linked to the operations tempo or to specific missions/business functions, and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business operations. Ideally, information security analysis teams are distributed within organizations to make the capability more resilient.


h3. The organization establishes an integrated team of forensic/malicious code analysts, tool developers, and real-time operations personnel.
