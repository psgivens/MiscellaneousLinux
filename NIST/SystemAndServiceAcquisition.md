h2. *SA-1*: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-1a.*: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
** *SA-1a.1.*: A system and services acquisition policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
** *SA-1a.2.*: Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and services acquisition policy and associated system and services acquisition controls; and
* *SA-1b.*: Reviews and updates the current:
** *SA-1b.1.*: System and services acquisition policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
** *SA-1b.2.*: System and services acquisition procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


----


h2. *SA-2*: ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

Resource allocation for information security includes funding for the initial information system or information system service acquisition and funding for the sustainment of the system/service.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-2a.*: Determines information security requirements for the information system or information system service in mission/business process planning;
* *SA-2b.*: Determines, documents, and allocates the resources required to protect the information system or information system service as part of its capital planning and investment control process; and
* *SA-2c.*: Establishes a discrete line item for information security in organizational programming and budgeting documentation.


----


h2. *SA-3*: SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-3a.*: Manages the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined system development life cycle] that incorporates information security considerations;
* *SA-3b.*: Defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the system development life cycle;
* *SA-3c.*: Identifies individuals having information security roles and responsibilities; and
* *SA-3d.*: Integrates the organizational information security risk management process into system development life cycle activities.


----


h2. *SA-4*: ACQUISITION PROCESS

Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an information system. Information system components include commercial information technology products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.
Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements from FISMA.


h3. The organization includes the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition contract for the information system, system component, or information system service in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs:

* *SA-4a.*: Security functional requirements;
* *SA-4b.*: Security strength requirements;
* *SA-4c.*: Security assurance requirements;
* *SA-4d.*: Security-related documentation requirements;
* *SA-4e.*: Requirements for protecting security-related documentation;
* *SA-4f.*: Description of the information system development environment and environment in which the system is intended to operate; and
* *SA-4g.*: Acceptance criteria.


----


h2. *SA-5*: INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-5a.*: Obtains administrator documentation for the information system, system component, or information system service that describes:
** *SA-5a.1.*: Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;
** *SA-5a.2.*: Effective use and maintenance of security functions/mechanisms; and
** *SA-5a.3.*: Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative (i.e., privileged) functions;
* *SA-5b.*: Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or information system service that describes:
** *SA-5b.1.*: User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security functions/mechanisms;
** *SA-5b.2.*: Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or service in a more secure manner; and
** *SA-5b.3.*: User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service;
* *SA-5c.*: Documents attempts to obtain information system, system component, or information system service documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in response;
* *SA-5d.*: Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and
* *SA-5e.*: Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


----


h2. *SA-8*: SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems. Security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to build secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs; (vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and (viii) reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.


h3. The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system.



----


h2. *SA-9*: EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES

External information system services are services that are implemented outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-9a.*: Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;
* *SA-9b.*: Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard  to external information system services; and
* *SA-9c.*: Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor security control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.


----


h2. *SA-10*: DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.


h3. The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

* *SA-10a.*: Perform configuration management during system, component, or service [Selection (one or more): design; development; implementation; operation];
* *SA-10b.*: Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to [Assignment: organization-defined configuration items under configuration management];
* *SA-10c.*: Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service;
* *SA-10d.*: Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security impacts of such changes; and
* *SA-10e.*: Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service and report findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel].


----


h2. *SA-11*: DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION

Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.


h3. The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

* *SA-11a.*: Create and implement a security assessment plan;
* *SA-11b.*: Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation at [Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];
* *SA-11c.*: Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the security testing/evaluation;
* *SA-11d.*: Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and
* *SA-11e.*: Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.


----


h2. *SA-12*: SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION

Information systems (including system components that compose those systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.


h3. The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system component, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.



----


h2. *SA-13*: TRUSTWORTHINESS

This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits.  Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in Appendix E).
Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems, system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for organizational information systems.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-13a.*: Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information system, information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical missions/business functions; and
* *SA-13b.*: Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such trustworthiness.


----


h2. *SA-14*: CRITICALITY ANALYSIS

Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades.


h3. The organization identifies critical information system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, information system components, or information system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle].



----


h2. *SA-15*: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS

Development tools include, for example, programming languages and computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for example, the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk assessment and mitigation, and requires robust configuration control throughout the life cycle (including design, development, transport, delivery, integration, and maintenance) to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-15a.*: Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to follow a documented development process that:
** *SA-15a.1.*: Explicitly addresses security requirements;
** *SA-15a.2.*: Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
** *SA-15a.3.*: Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and
** *SA-15a.4.*: Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and
* *SA-15b.*: Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].


----


h2. *SA-16*: DEVELOPER-PROVIDED TRAINING

This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style training, web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also request sufficient training materials from developers to conduct in-house training or offer self-training to organizational personnel. Organizations determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms.


h3. The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide [Assignment: organization-defined training] on the correct use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.



----


h2. *SA-17*: DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN

This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could also be used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal developers to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such security architecture is integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction is important if/when organizations outsource the development of information systems, information system components, or information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the organization�s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.


h3. The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:

* *SA-17a.*: Is consistent with and supportive of the organization�s security architecture which is established within and is an integrated part of the organization�s enterprise architecture;
* *SA-17b.*: Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of security controls among physical and logical components; and
* *SA-17c.*: Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.


----


h2. *SA-18*: TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION

Anti-tamper technologies and techniques provide a level of protection for critical information systems, system components, and information technology products against a number of related threats including modification, reverse engineering, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting information systems, components, and products during distribution and when in use.


h3. The organization implements a tamper protection program for the information system, system component, or information system service.



----


h2. *SA-19*: COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY

Sources of counterfeit components include, for example, manufacturers, developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policy and procedures support tamper resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations include, for example, US-CERT.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-19a.*: Develops and implements anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the information system; and
* *SA-19b.*: Reports counterfeit information system components to [Selection (one or more): source of counterfeit component; [Assignment: organization-defined external reporting organizations]; [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].


----


h2. *SA-20*: CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS

Organizations determine that certain information system components likely cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation or custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance. This is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom develop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g., enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and application files.


h3. The organization re-implements or custom develops [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].



----


h2. *SA-21*: DEVELOPER SCREENING

Because the information system, system component, or information system service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.


h3. The organization requires that the developer of [Assignment: organization-defined information system, system component, or information system service]:

* *SA-21a.*: Have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned [Assignment: organization-defined official government duties]; and
* *SA-21b.*: Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria].


----


h2. *SA-22*: UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS

Support for information system components includes, for example, software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.


h3. The organization:

* *SA-22a.*: Replaces information system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and
* *SA-22b.*: Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.
